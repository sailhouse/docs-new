## Welcome

Although we aim to provide as many [native SDKs](/sdks/introduction) as we possibly can, you can always talk straight to our API to do anything on Sailhouse.

## Authentication

Depending on the API endpoint you call, there will be different authentication requirements.

### App Tokens

When performing actions such as sending events, or pulling from a subscription, you will use an [app token](reference/tokens) to authenticate your application.

It must be included in a request within the `Authorization` header.

```
Authorization: sh_app_123......
```
