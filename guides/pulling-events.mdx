description: Learn how to pull and process events from pull subscriptions
---

Pull subscriptions allow you to actively retrieve events from Sailhouse when your application is ready to process them. This pattern is particularly useful for background workers or batch processing systems.

## Pulling Individual Events

When you pull an event from a subscription, Sailhouse implements a lock mechanism to ensure reliable processing:

```ts
const event = await client.pull('my-topic', 'my-subscription');
```

Each pulled event is automatically locked for 30 seconds. During this lock period:

- The event is invisible to other consumers
- Your application has exclusive access to process the event
- You must either acknowledge or abandon the event before the lock expires

<Note>
If the lock expires before acknowledgment, the event automatically returns to the front of the queue and becomes available for processing again.
</Note>

### Lock Behaviour

Here's how the locking mechanism works:

1. You pull an event from the subscription
2. Sailhouse applies a 30-second lock
3. One of three things happens:
   - You acknowledge the event → Event is removed from the queue
   - You abandon the event → Event returns to the queue immediately
   - Lock expires → Event returns to the front of the queue automatically

```ts
// Example of pulling and acknowledging an event
const event = await subscription.client.pull('user-created', 'send-welcome-email');

try {
    // Process the event
    await processEvent(event);

    // Acknowledge successful processing
    await event.ack();
} catch (error) {
    // Event will automatically return to queue after lock expires
    console.error('Failed to process event:', error);
}
```

<Warning>
If your processing takes over 30 seconds, you can configure the lock window on the subscription settings.
</Warning>

This locking mechanism helps prevent:
- Double-processing of events
- Lost events due to consumer failures
- Race conditions in multi-consumer scenarios
