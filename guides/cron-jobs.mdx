title: Cron jobs
---

<Info>
This feature is currently in **private** beta, to enable, please [contact us](mailto:support@sailhouse.dev).
</Info>

Cron jobs on Sailhouse allow you to, on a regular schedule, fire events into topics to trigger regular behaviour.

If you want to send a daily email roundup at 9am, or calculate usage every hour, cron jobs are the perfect way to do this.

## Creating a cron job

To define a cron, you can head to **Apps** -> `your_app` -> **Crons**, and click on **Create cron**.

<Frame caption="An app which has two existing cron jobs">

</Frame>

Here, you can define a name, the target topic, and the frequency of which it's triggered.

For example, here is a daily cron which runs at **1:30am UTC**.

<Frame>
<img src="/images/create-cron-modal.png" />
</Frame>

<Info>
All cron jobs are triggered in **UTC** time

## Handling a cron event

With cron events firing into regular [Sailhouse topics](/concepts/topics), you can subscribe to them as normal.

The event that's published contains useful metadata about the cron that triggered it.

```json
{
  "cron_id": "2hfy70ox3i5y",
  "cron_name": "Every 30 minutes",
  "cron_schedule": "0 */30 * * *"
}
```

You can read more about [subscribing to topics here.](/concepts/subscriptions)

## Editing a cron job

From the cron job page, you can edit the **name** and **schedule** of the cron, as well pausing/resuming on demand.

## Q&A

### When will cron jobs be released?

Cron jobs aim to launch within Q1 2025.

### What's the minimum amount of time between a cron run?

There is a hard system limitation of **1 minute** between subsequent runs.

Any definitions with shorter durations than this will run at 1 minute intervals.

### What if the events are unacknowledged?

As the topic the cron fires into is a regular topic, these will build up as per usual on subscriptions.

### Can I manually fire the cron?

As it's a normal topic, you can fire an event in as per usual! Just make sure to match the data/metadata if you depend on it.
